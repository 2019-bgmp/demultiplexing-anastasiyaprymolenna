PROBLEM:
	The reads that come off a sequencer arent perfect. They might have low quality, undetermined bases, or index hopping.
	This algorithm will filter the FASTQ files that come off the sequencer and output files separated into accepted and 
	confirmed index defined files for the forward and reverse reads




	
Algorithm GOAL:

Input: 
	FASTQ files (2 with biological reads, 2 with index reads)
	24 known indexes

Do:
	Demultiplex reads by index-pair

Output: 
	one forward FASTQ file (per matching index pair)
	one reverse FASTQ file (per matching index pair)
	two (F and R) FASTQ files for non-matching index pairs (ones that index hopped)
	two (F and R) FASTQ fules for unknown/low quality indexes
	
ADD sequence of the index-pair to the header of BOTH reads in all files 
	ie. Index1-Index2

ALSO:
	report number of read-pairs with properly matched indexes per index-pair
	report number of read pairs that index hopped
	report number of read pairs with unknown indexes

	
	
	
	
	
UNIT TESTS of all three cases and the expected output submitted seperately.








PSEUDOCODE AS FOLLOWS:

Argparse to allow options for user input:
	User input: R1(Read1), R2(Index1), R3(Index3), R4(Index4), Known_Index_File

def rev_comp(DNA_seq):
	''' Take DNA string and return its reverse compliment)'''
	Take the reverse compliment of DNA (use dictionary to assign base pairs)
	return DNA_rev_comp

def get_indexes(Known_Index_File):
	''' Take the entire .tsv file of known indexes and put all indexes  and their reverse complements into a dictionary'''
	For each line in the file, assign the index (contained in the second column) to a key
	rev_comp(key) and assign that as the value for each key in the dictionary 
	flip the key value pairs so rev comp is the key and OG index is the value, add these pairs to the dictionary
	return index_dictionary

index_dict = get_indexes(Index_file)
	
open each of the four files individually for reading
	write files will be opened in the loops as things are written to them
read in four lines at a time from both files at once
take the second line from the index files that contains the Index read and compare 
	if the quality of an index is below a determnined threshold (LOW QUALITY)
		write the header line concatenated with 'index1-index2' to the unknown forward and reverse file
		write the sequence, +, and quality line to the respective unknown forward or reverse file
	if the two indexes match a key,value pair in the dictionary (MATCHED)
		write the header line concatenated with 'index1-index2' to forward and reverse files named after the indexes 	#####maybe write a
		write the sequence, +, and quality line to their respective forward and reverse files named after the indexes	#####def function for this
	if the index sequence line contains an 'N' (UNDETERMINED)
		write the header line concatenated with 'index1-index2' to the unknown forward and reverse file
		write the sequence, +, and quality line to the respective unknown forward or reverse file
	if the either of the indexes matches a key or value in the dictionary that is not its direct dictionary pair (INDEX HOPPED)
		write the header line concatenated with 'index1-index2' to the index-hopped forward and reverse file
		write the sequence, +, and quality line to the respective unknown forward or reverse file
	if one of the indexes doesn't match any dictionary key or value and doesnt contain 'N' (LOW QUALITY)
		write the header line concatenated with 'index1-index2' to the unknown forward and reverse file
		write the sequence, +, and quality line to the respective unknown forward or reverse file
		
close each file that was open for reading

count the number of records in each of the forward files 
	output counts in a table with respect to the file that it came from
